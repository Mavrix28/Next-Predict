# Next-Predict

## Next-Word Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts the next word in a sentence using a trained LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. This project demonstrates the application of natural language processing (NLP) and sequence prediction...

 ## Features

	•	Predicts the next word based on an input sequence of words.
	•	Uses a trained LSTM model for word-level sequence prediction.
	•	Interactive web-based interface using Streamlit.
